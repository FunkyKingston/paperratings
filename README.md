This is a personal project of mine, on my quest to master web development! I am currently teaching myself some Python-based backend development (currently focusing on Django, as in this project) and React-based frontend, here with Redux used for state management.

It is work-in-progress, but the page as is is currently hosted at Heroku, to be precise at https://funky-django-react.herokuapp.com/
